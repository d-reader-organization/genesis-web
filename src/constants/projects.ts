Under the rule of B.E.G., the once thriving metropolis has deteriorated into a dystopian wasteland, where corruption thrives and hope has faded. This speculative fiction series follows the lives of a group of individuals, collectively known as The Syndicate, displaced by the war and now navigating the challenges of this new world. Through the dark & shadowy streets and the barren outskirts, each character confronts their own struggles, their stories intertwining as they reunite, their bonds strengthened by adversity, to confront the challenges of the present while facing the demons of their past. Staring down the reality of extinction, they come to understand that their battle extends beyond challenging the oppressive regime to confronting their own inner conflicts. "Originz" offers a grounded exploration of resilience amidst adversity where every step forward carries the weight of history.',

        text: `Spiders and gerbils and poodles, oh my! In The Lump Sum Saga, we join a team of scientists from the planet "Home" on a daring mission to land a probe on an alien world capable of supporting life - Earth. 

              The eclectic cast of characters includes:
              • JoJo: an LWD (little white dog) who becomes the unexpected nexus between two worlds. 
              • The Commander: The spider-esque Darksider lead of the alien landing team is still alive. Stranded in a world of giants, can she use her cunning and intelligence to find a way to call Home?
              • The President: The profoundly intelligent leader of the rodent-like Lightsiders wants to save his only love, and his planet at the same time.

              What starts as an eclectic sci-fi adventure soon becomes a very familiar superhero epic that finally answers the question "What if the spider had a story?"`,
